## Supervised Learning: Titanic Survival

# Description

In 1912, the ship RMS Titanic struck an iceberg on its maiden voyage and sank, resulting in the deaths of most of its passengers and crew. In this introductory project, we will explore a subset of the RMS Titanic passenger manifest to determine which features best predict whether someone survived or did not survive.


# Data

From a sample of the RMS Titanic data, we can see the various features present for each passenger on the ship:


Survived: Outcome of survival (0 = No; 1 = Yes)

Pclass: Socio-economic class (1 = Upper class; 2 = Middle class; 3 = Lower class)

Name: Name of passenger

Sex: Sex of the passenger

Age: Age of the passenger (Some entries contain NaN)

SibSp: Number of siblings and spouses of the passenger aboard

Parch: Number of parents and children of the passenger aboard

Ticket: Ticket number of the passenger

Fare: Fare paid by the passenger

Cabin Cabin number of the passenger (Some entries contain NaN)

Embarked: Port of embarkation of the passenger (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)


Since we're interested in the outcome of survival for each passenger or crew member, we can remove the Survived feature from this dataset and store it as its own separate variable outcomes. We will use these outcomes as our prediction targets.

# Run the project

To run the project, create a local directory and save the titanic\_survival.py and titanic\_data.csv there. Then simply run the script and see the results as output. Only pandas are used from external libraries. See the questions below to make sense of the output of the script. 


# Questions 

## Question 1

Using the RMS Titanic data, how accurate would a prediction be that none of the passengers survived?

## Question 2

How accurate would a prediction be that all female passengers survived and the remaining passengers did not survive?

## Question 3

How accurate would a prediction be that all female passengers and all male passengers younger than 10 survived?

## Question 4

Describe the steps you took to implement the final prediction model so that it got an accuracy of at least 80%. What features did you look at? Were certain features more informative than others? Which conditions did you use to split the survival outcomes in the data? How accurate are your predictions?

## Question 5

Think of a real-world scenario where supervised learning could be applied. What would be the outcome variable that you are trying to predict? Name two features about the data used in this scenario that might be helpful for making the predictions.
